# Search for recipes

CodeFirstGirls final project.

Using fundamentals of Python to create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The standard project uses the Edamam Recipe API.

This was a group project (the only pairs of the cohort) where we planned the MVP and each member worked on a different part of the code. Reviewing and refractoring eachothers code within the timeframe.

## Specification

### MVP

- Ask the user to enter an ingredient that they want to search for
- Create a function that makes a request to the Edamam API with the required ingredient as part of the search query (also included your Application ID and Application Key
- Get the returned recipes from the API response
- Display the recipes for each search result

### Extension from the MVP

- Save the results to a file
- Order the results by Calories
- Ask the user additional questions to decide which recipe they should choose
- Cross-reference the ingredient against the Edamam nutrition analysis API

## How to use

```
git clone git@github.com:mandyvuong/Search-for-recipes.git
```

Register to Edamam Recipe API to retrieve a key and id and use this to update the code

```
https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api
```

Run the program.

## Improvements to be made

- Meaningful variable names
- Meaningful function names
- Commenting of code
- Refractoring, breaking down code into functions
